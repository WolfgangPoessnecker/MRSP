MRSP is an R package written by Wolfgang Pößnecker for the purpose of fitting (M)ultinomial (R)esponse Models with (S)tructured (P)enalties. 

This repository seeks to share the latest, often times experimental, versions of MRSP. 

The most recent commit contains version 0.6.11, which adds preliminary support for the fitting of Cumulative and Sequential Models with any of the usual penalties offered by MRSP. The code for these ordinal models is in an early beta state, and the functionality for ordinal models is not yet documented. Use at your own risk!
